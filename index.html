        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      
        <p>Hello! My name is Ayaan Chowdhury, and I‚Äôm a 19-year-old Computer Science student at the University of South Wales. I‚Äôm deeply passionate about exploring the world of technology and solving real-world problems through creative coding solutions. I thrive on pushing boundaries, learning new skills, and challenging myself to grow every day.</p>
       
        <p>When I‚Äôm not immersed in my studies, you‚Äôll likely find me enjoying one of my favorite pastimes‚Äîgaming. I believe gaming not only serves as a source of entertainment but also inspires my interest in user interface design, interactive systems, and immersive experiences.</p>
        
        <p>I hope to develop my own indie game one day by implementing all of my current knowledge gathered from previous experiences in coding clubs. I am also an avid chess player as I enjoy challenging myself and constantly developing my intelligence by any means possible.</p>
